# FIXME: it would be better to separate this workflow into three reusable workflows:
# package, for compiling the extension to .vsix (on every push),
# publish-msmarketplace, for publishing the .vsix file to ms marketplace (on tag push),
# publish-openvsix, for publishing the .vsix file to open vsix (on tag push)
# these last two could be separated and open sourced as actions
# but for now this works tho lol
